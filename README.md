This is an unfinished code for use with JMRI, MQTT using ESP8266 and Rpi's. It is still a work in progress, has many bugs but as I fix them I will update the files.

The plan is to be able to simply enter in each light or turnout in the ino file and the code will automatically subsribe to the relevant topics, build the arrays, and begin the system.
